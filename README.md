# BMI Calculator

This is a Java program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for height and weight. The BMI is a commonly used metric to assess whether a person has a healthy weight relative to their height.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. Locate the `BMICalculator.java` file in the source code.
4. Compile and run the `BMICalculator.java` file to start the program.
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your height and weight values.
6. The program will calculate your BMI and display the result, along with a corresponding interpretation.

## Formula Used

The BMI is calculated using the following formula:

```
BMI = weight / (height * height)
```

Where:
- `weight` is the weight in kilograms.
- `height` is the height in meters.

## Interpretation of Results

The program provides an interpretation of the calculated BMI based on the World Health Organization (WHO) classifications:

- BMI < 18.5: Underweight
- 18.5 <= BMI < 25: Normal weight
- 25 <= BMI < 30: Overweight
- BMI >= 30: Obese

## Error Handling

The program includes error handling to ensure that the user's input is valid and within acceptable ranges. It will prompt the user to re-enter the values if they are not within the expected range.
